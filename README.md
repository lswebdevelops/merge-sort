README

This repository contains two JavaScript scripts: one for solving the Fibonacci sequence recursively and another for implementing merge sort algorithm.

Merge Sort Algorithm
The merge sort algorithm implemented in this script is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the input array into smaller arrays until each array contains only one element. Then, it merges these arrays back together in sorted order until the entire array is sorted.
To run this script, simply copy the code and paste it into a JavaScript file. Then, save the file and run it in a web browser or in a Node.js environment.

Fibonacci Sequence
The second script contains a function that recursively generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the n-th number in the sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting with 0 and 1.
To run this script, copy the code and paste it into a JavaScript file. Then, save the file and run it in a web browser or in a Node.js environment. The function takes one argument, n, which is the index of the last number in the sequence to be generated. The function returns an array containing the Fibonacci sequence up to and including the n-th number.

Note: This implementation uses recursion, which can cause performance issues for large values of n. Consider using an iterative solution for larger values of n.
